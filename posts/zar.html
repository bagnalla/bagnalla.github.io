<h3 id="rolling-the-bones">Rolling the Bones</h3>
<p>One of the things that came out of my PhD research is a framework
(part of the overall <a href="https://github.com/bagnalla/zar">Zar</a>
probabilistic programming system) for building samplers for discrete
probability distributions with <em>formal proofs of correctness</em> in
Coq. One such example of a discrete distribution is the <em>n-sided die</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the following hypothetical: Suppose you want to roll a
6-sided die but you don’t have one lying around. You <em>do</em> have a coin
though, which presumably is not biased (i.e., it is <em>fair</em>, with equal
probability of flipping heads or tails). How could you simulate rolls
of the die using only the fair coin?</p>
<p>Samplers built with Zar can be thought of as <em>fair coin transformers</em>,
taking as input a fair coin (represented as a stream of uniformly
distributed Booleans where <code>true</code> stands for <code>heads</code> and <code>false</code> for
<code>tails</code>) and producing as output a stream of samples from the desired
probability distribution. The proofs of correctness say that as long
as the input coin is fair, the output samples will indeed be
distributed according to the intended distribution.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll look at Zar’s answer to the question of
simulating an n-sided die using a fair coin, and then we’ll see how to
use it via the <a href="TODO">Zar OCaml package</a> (and its <a href="TODO">Haskell
equivalent</a>) to generate samples that are formally proved to be
uniformly distributed. Although Zar supports sampling from arbitrary
discrete distributions, we’ll just focus on uniform sampling (“rolling
an n-sided die”) for now.</p>
<p>You might think that uniform sampling is trivial and shouldn’t require
formal verification, but the reality is that bugs in uniform samplers
such as “modulo bias” are a <a href="https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2020/07/28/the-definitive-guide-to-modulo-bias-and-how-to-avoid-it/">notorious vulnerability in cryptographic
systems</a>. Rigorous
testing can only take you so far; to quote Edsger Dijkstra: “Program
testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show
their absence!” The samplers built using Zar come with <em>a priori</em>
formal guarantees of the accuracy of their output distributions, which
for the n-sided die means no modulo bias, period.</p>
<h1 id="simulating-an-n-sided-die">Simulating an N-sided Die</h1>
<p>First let’s look at a high-level algorithm for simulating an n-sided
die. We’ll start with the special case of when <code>n</code> is a power of <code>2</code>,
and from there we can generalize to any <code>n &gt; 0</code>.</p>
<h2 id="dyadic-dice">Dyadic Dice</h2>
<p>When <code>n</code> is a power of <code>2</code>, the solution is easy: flip the coin
<code>lg(n)</code> times and interpret the resulting string of outcomes as the
bits of a binary encoded integer, where <code>heads</code> denotes <code>1</code> and
<code>tails</code> denotes <code>0</code>. For example, to simulate an 8-sided die (with
values ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>7</code>), we roll the coin <code>lg(8) = 3</code> times to
generate a bit sequence such as <code>010</code> (interpreted as the integer <code>2</code>)
or <code>110</code> (interpreted as <code>6</code>). We can visualize this process as a
complete binary tree where each branch represents a flip of the coin
and each leaf contains a possible output in the range <code>[0,7)</code>:</p>
<p>TODO: tree diagram</p>
<p>By looking at the tree representation we can clearly see that that the
probabilities of all possible outcomes are exactly equal to <code>(1/2)³ = 1/8</code>.</p>
<h2 id="rejection-sampling">Rejection Sampling</h2>
<p>But what if <code>n</code> isn’t a power of <code>2</code>? One approach is to flip more
bits than are actually needed, and whenever the resulting sample
exceeds <code>n</code> simply throw it away and try again. I.e., implement a
<em>rejection sampler</em>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Flip <code>lg(n)+1</code> bits to obtain a bit sequence representing integer
<code>k</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>k &lt; n</code>, accept <code>k</code> as the sample. Otherwise, reject the sample
and return to step 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’re basically just taking a sampler for the first power of <code>2</code>
greater than <code>n</code> and wrapping it in a loop that repeats when the
sample it produces is <code>≥ n</code>. It’s intuitively obvious that all
accepted samples have equal probability because they have equal
probabilities under the base sampler inside the loop. We can visualize
these rejection samplers too as binary trees (though not necessarily
complete binary trees) where rejected leaves loop back to the
root. E.g., for a 6-sided die:</p>
<p>TODO: rejection tree diagram</p>
<p>You might notice that it’s technically not a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> since it
contains cycles. However, we can think of it instead as convenient
notation for the infinite binary tree that repeats a copy of itself
upon rejection rather than looping around:</p>
<p>TODO: rejection infinite tree diagram</p>
<p>So it really is a tree (with repeating self-similar structure) as long
as you allow for infinite trees, which are no problem in a lazy
language like Haskell and can be encoded using
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunks</a>” in non-lazy languages
or as coinductive types in proof assistants like
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> and
<a href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a>.</p>
<p>One downside of our move to rejection sampling is that we can no
longer take termination for granted. The 6-sided die sampler could
conceivably take the rejection path at every iteration and loop
forever without ever producing a sample. However, we can see that the
probability of rejecting <code>n</code> times in a row is <code>(1/4)ⁿ</code>, which tends
to <code>0</code> as <code>n</code> goes to <code>+∞</code>. Thus, the probability of rejecting
infinitely many times is <code>0</code>, and the probability of eventually
terminating after <code>n</code> steps for some <code>n</code> is therefore <code>1</code>. In other
words, the 6-sided die sampler is an “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost
surely</a>” terminating
process, which for our purposes is good enough to ensure practical
utility. A similar argument applies for any other rejection sampler
with nonzero probability of accepting the sample at each iteration.</p>
<!-- Although it is not guaranteed to terminate in an absolute sense, we -->
<!-- may say that the sampler "[almost -->
<!-- surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely)" terminates, -->
<!-- which for our purposes is good enough. A similar argument applies for -->

<!-- ## Zar for OCaml -->
<p>The <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/zar/">Zar OCaml package</a> provides
a simple wrapper API around formally verified samplers extracted from
Coq. The easiest way to get it is through opam:</p>
<pre><code>opam install zar</code></pre>
<p>Once installed, you can simply list <code>zar</code> as a dependency in your dune
project to gain access to everything in the <code>Zar</code> namespace. A sample
project containing the code in this article can be found <a href="TODO">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since there doesn’t seem to be a standard streaming library for OCaml
(although
<a href="https://ocaml.org/p/streaming/0.8.0/doc/index.html">streaming</a> looks
promising), Zar defines its own stream type with the following
interface (from
<a href="https://github.com/bagnalla/ocamlzar/blob/main/lib/zar.mli">zar.mli</a>):</p>

<p>If you recall from our introduction, Zar samplers can be thought of as
<em>fair coin transformers</em>. The basic construction for the n-sided die
is therefore given by <code>die_transformer</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">val</span> die_transformer : <span class="dt">int</span> -&gt; <span class="dt">bool</span> stream -&gt; <span class="dt">int</span> stream</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For any <code>n &gt; 0</code>, <code>die_transformer n</code> is a function that transforms a
stream of fair coin flips into a stream of n-sided die rolls. To start
rolling the die, we just need to apply the transformer to an
appropriate source. Zar contains a default source of fair coin flips
built on OCaml’s <code>Random</code> module:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">(** Default uniformly distributed random bit stream. *)</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">val</span> bits : <span class="dt">unit</span> -&gt; <span class="dt">bool</span> stream</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">(** Initialize PRNG used for default bit stream. *)</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">val</span> seed : <span class="dt">unit</span> -&gt; <span class="dt">unit</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By applying <code>die_transformer 6</code> to <code>bits ()</code>, the following code
generates a list of 10 rolls of a 6-sided die:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">let</span> die = Zar.die_transformer <span class="dv">6</span> @@ Zar.bits () <span class="kw">in</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">let</span> samples = Zar.take <span class="dv">10</span> die <span class="kw">in</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">(* Do something with samples *)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or, the following equivalent shortcut for using the default source of
coin flips:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">let</span> samples = Zar.take <span class="dv">10</span> (Zar.die <span class="dv">6</span>) <span class="kw">in</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">(* Do something with samples *)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Zar package supports not only n-sided dice but also biased coins
and arbitrary finite distributions specified by lists of weights. You
can learn more about them in the package
