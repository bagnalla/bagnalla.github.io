<h3 id="death-and-the-egg">Death and the Egg</h3>
<p>One of the troubling aspects of Darwinism is that it seems to imply
that all biological organisms (humans included) are instinctively
selfish. Self-sacrificing traits do not confer adaptive advantage
(i.e., enhanced reproductive success) to the individuals who possess
them. On the contrary, self-serving behavior does tend to improve
reproductive success. Therefore we should expect to find no shortage
of selfish traits among the extant members of a given species, and we
ought to be surprised to find altruistic traits. However, we all know
from everyday experience (and examples from nature such as the social
insects) that individuals do often act in selfless ways for the
benefit of others. Does that mean that Darwinism is wrong?</p>

<h1 id="the-selfish-gene">The Selfish Gene</h1>
<p>In his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins argues (drawing
from literature by various figures including W. D. Hamilton and John
Maynard Smith) that Darwinian reasoning applied at the right level of
abstraction (the level of the <em>gene</em>) actually does predict the
evolution of altruism. The key idea is to take a “gene’s eye view” of
natural selection. That is, we should not think of the fitness of
individuals (I use the term “individual” here to mean the body of an
organism), but rather the fitness of particular <em>genes</em>. A gene that
induces self-sacrificing behavior of the “survival machine” it
occupies can successfully propagate through the gene pool if that
behavior is sufficiently profitable to other survival machines
carrying copies of the same gene. Thus even a Darwinist should expect
to find certain kinds of altruism between individuals in nature (see,
e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection">kin
selection</a>). It isn’t the
individuals who are necessarily selfish – it’s the genes.</p>
<h1 id="group-selection">Group Selection</h1>
<p>Another possible explanation for the evolution of altruism goes by the
name “group selection”. Group selection is the idea that natural
selection may act at the level of groups (e.g., races or species) to
optimize for individual characteristics that serve “for the good of
the group”. For example, it might be said that the female honeybee
(who dies a gruesome death after using her stinger) sacrifices herself
for the good of the colony, or that male chimpanzees submit to a
dominant male for the sake of peace within the group rather than
fighting to the death for the right to mate.</p>
<p>Dawkins spills a fair amount of ink arguing that group selection is
not the right way to think about evolution (and from what I understand
he is far from being alone on this issue). He insists that natural
selection must be understood at the level of the <em>gene</em> and not at the
level of individuals nor groups of related individuals. The definition
of “gene” is somewhat vague, and may actually include coalitions or
working groups of distinct protein-coding DNA sequences, but that’s
beside the point. According to Dawkins, natural selection properly
understood means “survival of the fittest genes”, not “survival of the
fittest individuals” or “survival of the fittest groups”.</p>
<h1 id="guillemots">Guillemots</h1>
<!-- ![](../images/guillemot_with_egg.JPG){ style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 20%" } -->
<p>An interesting counterexample against the idea of group selection
arises from the brooding behavior of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemot">guillemots</a> (a type of auk
perhaps best known for the <a href="https://youtu.be/VMSTzfF3udY">daring feats of their
chicks</a>). Guillemots lay eggs in dense
communal colonies. They don’t make much for nests, so their eggs tend
to roll around a bit. Every egg is decorated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uria_aalge_MHNT_Box_Rouzic.jpg">unique pattern of
shapes and
colors</a>
that its parents use to tell it apart from other eggs. Parents
incubate their own eggs and ignore others. That is, they follow a
selfish brooding strategy by selectively caring only for their own
offspring.</p>
<p>Why should guillemots go through so much trouble to be selfish? The
selfish strategy requires the support of a fairly advanced complex of
adaptations including the formation of intricate egg markings and the
visual acuity and cognitive ability needed to recognize them. It may
even induce additional costs in terms of energy use. A simpler (and
more altruistic) strategy would be to not discriminate between eggs at
all and to incubate whatever eggs are lying around. The downside to
the altruistic strategy would be negligible as long as most of the
other guillemots are also doing it. From a group-selectionist point of
view we might expect the altruistic strategy to dominate since
selfishness doesn’t benefit the species as a whole and is perhaps even
moderately harmful.</p>
<p>We can investigate by simulating natural selection of brooding
strategies in a population of guillemots. We’ll implement the
simulation in <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">bevy</a>, a game engine for
Rust. <a href="https://bagnalla.github.io/posts/newton_bevy.html">My previous
post</a> gives a brief
introduction to bevy, but it isn’t really necessary for understanding
the present article. The code is available
<a href="https://github.com/bagnalla/guillemot">here</a>.</p>
<p>The simulation is based on the basic Darwinian principles of 1) random
hereditary mutations and 2) differential reproductive outcomes due to
those mutations. We’ll begin by looking at three basic types of
brooding strategies modelled in the simulation.</p>
<h2 id="the-altruist">The Altruist</h2>
<p><img src="../images/altruist.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; width: 20%" /></p>
<p>The altruist wanders around aimlessly, occasionally laying an
egg. After laying an egg, she continues to wander and may continue to
lay more eggs. Whenever her path happens to cross with an egg she
always (whether it is her egg or not) sit and incubates the egg until
it hatches into a new guillemot.</p>
<p>A population of altruists is able to thrive quite well by
indiscriminately tending to one another’s eggs:</p>
<p><video src="../videos/altruist1.mkv" controls><a href="../videos/altruist1.mkv">Video</a></video></p>
<p>There is always the chance that an egg expires before anyone gets to
it (a small chance however when the population is sufficiently large),
but that is equally likely to occur for all members of the group, so
no one guillemot has any reproductive advantage over the others (at
least not due to brooding strategy).</p>
<h2 id="the-selfish">The Selfish</h2>
<p><img src="../images/selfish.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; width: 20%" /></p>
<p>The selfish guillemot wanders like the altruist, but whenever she lays
an egg she immediately incubates the egg until it hatches. We will
assume that there is an inherent cost for adopting the selfish
strategy, perhaps due to some genetic tradeoff for the required
adaptations (e.g., egg markings and visual acuity), or perhaps due to
the additional stress of worrying about one’s own egg, or whatever
else it might be. We’ll model the cost of selfishness in our
simulation as a 1.3x multiplier on the rate of aging, causing selfish
guillemots to have significantly shorter lifespans on average than
their altruistic cousins.</p>
<p>Altruistic and selfish guillemots can coexist peacefully in a brooding
community provided that the altruists are numerous enough to support
their own subset of the population:</p>
<p><video src="../videos/altruist_selfish1.mkv" controls><a href="../videos/altruist_selfish1.mkv">Video</a></video></p>
<p>Selfishness is a reliable way of ensuring the survival of one’s own
offspring, but altruism seems to be the better strategy overall due to
the longer average lifespan of altruists. All seems well – what could
possibly go wrong?</p>
<h2 id="the-cheat">The Cheat</h2>
<p><img src="../images/cheater.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; width: 20%" /></p>
<p>The cheat wanders and lays eggs exactly like an altruist, but she
never actually incubates any eggs that she encounters. She simply
continues to lay eggs for her entire life, relying solely on the
generosity of altruists for incubating them. It’s important to note
that the cheat isn’t necessarily aware of fact that she is
“cheating”. She just happens to have stumbled upon an unconscious
strategy (presumably due to some genetic mutation) that performs well
in an environment rich with altruism. Moreover, there is little cost
for adopting the cheater strategy because, unlike selfishness, it
doesn’t require any special adaptations. The cheat could just be an
altruist who has “forgotten” how to incubate.</p>
<p>A population containing only altruists and cheats tends to balance out
at an optimal ratio of approximately 1:1 altruists to cheats:</p>
<p><video src="../videos/altruist_cheat1.mkv" controls><a href="../videos/altruist_cheat1.mkv">Video</a></video></p>
<p>But something interesting happens when selfishness is introduced into
the mix. This is what we will investigate with the simulation. But
first, let’s see how the simulation models genes and reproduction.</p>
<h2 id="the-genes">The Genes</h2>
<p>Every guillemot carries a set of “genes” that influences their choice
of brooding strategy. We model these genes as a probability
distribution over the three strategies, encoded as a three-dimensional
vector of floats that sum to 1:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">struct</span> Genes(Vec3)<span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>A guillemot’s strategy is fixed at birth (when it hatches from its
egg) by drawing a <code>Strategy</code> from the probability distribution
determined by its genes.</p>

<p>In the real world, a guillemot chick inherits a mixture of the genes
of its two parents. We instead use a simplified model of reproduction
where a single parent endows her eggs with slightly mutated copies of
her own genes (thereby sidestepping issues like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blending_inheritance">blending
inheritance</a>). Genes
are mutated by applying a small additive Gaussian noise to each gene
component and then renormalizing to sum to 1:</p>

<p>For this article we let <code>gauss</code> be a normal distribution centered at
<code>0</code> with standard deviation <code>0.01</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simulation">The Simulation</h2>
<p>The brooding area is a square grid of discrete locations. The
simulation proceeds in discrete “ticks”, executing the following steps
on every tick:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each guillemot,
<ul>
<li>if currently incubating an egg, do nothing.</li>
<li>Otherwise:
<ul>
<li>Die with probability <code>DEATH_RATE * age</code> (where <code>DEATH_RATE</code> is a
fixed constant, chosen as <code>1/500</code> in our examples).</li>
<li>Or, lay an egg in a randomly chosen adjacent location (if an
empty one is available) with probability <code>birth_rate</code> (where
<code>birth_rate</code> is not a fixed constant but is calculated based on
the difference between the current population and the capacity
of the environment, so that the birth rate is high when the
current population is low and vice versa). If following the
selfish strategy, move to the egg and begin incubating it
immediately.</li>
<li>Or, choose a random adjacent location. If the location is empty,
move to it. If the location contains an unattended egg and we
are following the altruistic strategy, move to the egg and begin
incubating.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For each egg,
<ul>
<li>If <code>age &gt;= EGG_EXPIRATION</code> and not being incubated, die (where
<code>EGG_EXPIRATION</code> is a constant).</li>
<li>If being incubated and <code>age &gt;= INCUBATION_PERIOD</code> then hatch in a
randomly chosen adjacent empty location (since the current
location is already occupied by the incubating guillemot). If no
such location exists, the newly hatched guillemot dies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Hatching when <code>age &gt;= INCUBATION_PERIOD</code> is a minor
hack/simplification that is slightly unrealistic but doesn’t really
matter for our purposes (technically an egg could hatch after just a
few ticks of incubation if it was found by a guillemot right before it
would have expired). Note also that in our simulation guillemots can’t
die while incubating. This causes altruists to have longer lifespans
but overall the same lifetime number of eggs laid on average as
cheats.</p>
<h2 id="stability">Stability</h2>
<p>We should expect a strategy to dominate only if it is an
<em>evolutionarily stable strategy</em> (ESS). A strategy is said to be an
ESS when, given that the entire population has already adopted the
strategy, no individual can improve their expected reproductive
success by deviating from it. ESS’s are roughly analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash
equilibria</a>. Being an
ESS is not sufficient to guarantee adoption by a given population, but
it is necessary. That is, a strategy must be an ESS to have any chance
of gaining widespread and lasting adoptance by any population under
the effects of natural selection.</p>
<p>The selfish brooding strategy is an ESS. If the entire guillemot
population is selfish, no individual guillemot can benefit (in terms
of reproductive success) by switching to a different strategy. This is
because altruism and cheating are only viable when many altruists
already exist. We can confirm that selfishness is an ESS by simulating
a purely selfish population of guillemots (setting their genes to give
probability <code>1</code> to the selfish strategy), and increasing the scale and
speed of the simulation:</p>
<p><video src="../videos/selfish2.mkv" controls><a href="../videos/selfish2.mkv">Video</a></video></p>
<p>We see an altruist or cheat pop up here and there due to random
mutations, but selfishness persists as the dominant strategy for the
vast majority.</p>
<p>Cheating, on the other hand, is not an ESS. In a population full of
cheaters an individual guillemot’s expected reproductive reward is
nil. It can do better by switching to either altruism (where it will
have at least some chance to incubate its own egg) or
selfishness. Realistically, though, a population of cheaters would
probably go extinct before having the chance to adapt to other
strategies.</p>
<p>What about altruism? Is it an ESS? Let’s suppose for a moment that the
mutations for selfishness are not available, so that the only possible
strategies are altruism and cheating. We can disable selfishness and
start the simulation with a population of pure altruists (and speed up
the simulation even more):</p>
<p><video src="../videos/altruist_cheat2_muted.mkv" controls><a href="../videos/altruist_cheat2_muted.mkv">Video</a></video></p>
<p>We see that it eventually converges to a stable equilibrium with a
ratio of approximately 1:1 altruists to cheats. It may in principle be
possible for the population to be divided into two separate families,
one purely altruistic and the other purely cheaters. But what’s really
happening in our simulation is convergence to a stable gene
configuration that assigns <code>1/2</code> probability to altruism and <code>1/2</code>
probability to cheating. From the genes’ point of view, the “strategy”
is actually a probability distribution over <code>Strategy</code>s (i.e., a mixed
strategy). The ESS here is a mixed strategy between altruism and
cheating. And when we said earlier that selfishness is an ESS, what we
really meant is that the gene configuration that assigns probability
<code>1</code> to the selfish <code>Strategy</code> is an ESS. It turns out that ESS’s
correspond not to <em>pure</em> nash equilibria but rather to <em>mixed Nash
equilibria</em> (where “mixed” means a probability distribution over a set
of possible “pure” strategies). The cool thing about mixed equilibria
is that, unlike pure equilibria, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium#Nash's_existence_theorem">they always
exist</a>,
and so too do ESS’s.</p>
<p>So what happens when we allow for selfishness? Let’s enable selfish
mutations and restart the simulation, again with an initial population
of pure altruists:</p>
<p><video src="../videos/selfish_ess.mkv" controls><a href="../videos/selfish_ess.mkv">Video</a></video></p>
<p>We should remember that the guillemots are not consciously deciding to
become selfish. Rather, natural selection on generations builds into
them an unconscious rule of thumb (together with the necessary
physical adaptations) for following the evolutionarily stable
strategy.</p>
